# üìù To-Do List (Python Project)

This project is a **To-Do List Manager** built using **Python and Tkinter** as part of my **CodSoft Internship**.  
It focuses on creating a simple yet interactive way to manage tasks while practicing GUI development in Python.  

---

## üéØ Objective
The main objective of this project is to design and implement a Python-based To-Do List that allows users to:  
- Add, delete, and update tasks  
- Track their daily progress  
- Stay motivated with simple animations and progress tracking  

This project demonstrates my ability to apply Python concepts in a practical, real-world scenario.

##  Features
-  Add new tasks with timestamps  
-  Mark tasks as completed  
-  Delete tasks easily  
-  Visual progress bar to track completion  
-  Confetti animation when finishing tasks  
-  Hover effects for interactive buttons  
-  Scrollable task list for better organization  


## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Run
1. Make sure you have **Python 3.7+** installed.  
2. Clone the repository:  
   navigate into folder
   run the program

üìå Internship Context
This project was completed as part of my CodSoft Python Programming Internship.
It reflects the application of programming fundamentals to create a small but functional project, helping me strengthen my problem-solving and GUI development skills.

üèÅ Conclusion
The To-Do List project provided a hands-on opportunity to explore GUI programming in Python.
It not only enhanced my technical skills but also showed how simple ideas can be turned into interactive tools.
This project marks an important step in my learning journey with CodSoft.
